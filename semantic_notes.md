# Semantics

In this file I compiled a list of semantic definitions and requirements. The purpose of this is to have a nice, simple and comprehensive 
list of all semantics checks I will have to take care of. 

All information in this file were acquired from the [ISO/IEC 9899:TC3 WG14/N1256 Commitee Draft](https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf)
available at https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf. Although this is only the draft, it differs only minimally from the final C99
standard[^1]

Another very good source of compiled information about the C language is [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language). If there are any doubts this site
should clear them up.
